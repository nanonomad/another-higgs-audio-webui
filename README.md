Another WebUI for Higgs Audio V2

I use this fork of the project/quantized model:

https://github.com/Nyarlth/higgs-audio_quantized

Put voice samples in voice_prompts/


Disclaimer:

This is mostly vibe-coded trash, but works well enough for my purposes. If you saw the spaghetti I had before asking LLMs to clean it up, well..

Notes:

Speakers may gender-swap if doing multi-speaker segments. I haven't figured out how to fix that. I'm doing something wrong passing the prompt to the model, I think. IDK.

The incorrect temp filenames are shown in the generation history.

The generation queue does not refresh in the browser, but the refresh button does work if you have a long queue.

I will, probably, never fix any of these.

I tend to use this for voice cloning, and it works very well for what I need.
