Another WebUI for Higgs Audio V2
I use this fork of the project/quantized model: https://github.com/Nyarlth/higgs-audio_quantized

Put voice samples in voice_prompts/


Disclaimer:
This is mostly vibe-coded trash, but works well enough for my purposes. If you saw the spaghetti I had before asking LLMs to clean it up, well..

Notes:
Speakers may gender-swap if doing multi-speaker segments. I haven't figured out how to fix that. I'm doing something wrong passing the prompt to the model, I think. IDK.

I tend to use this for voice cloning, and it works very well for what I need.
